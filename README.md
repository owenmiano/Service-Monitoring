# Service-Monitoring
This repository contains a system designed for monitoring services listed in a CSV file. Each service is independently monitored at defined intervals, and the system logs the status of each service along with the reachability of the hosting server. Timestamps are included in the logs to provide a chronological record of when each status was logged.
